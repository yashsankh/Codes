# Titanic Dataset Analysis
# Overview
This project aims to analyze the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The goal is to gain insights into factors that may have influenced survival rates and to build a predictive model for survival.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It includes the following features:

Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Name: The name of the passenger.
Sex: The gender of the passenger.
Age: The age of the passenger.
SibSp: The number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: The number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: The ticket number.
Fare: The amount of money paid for the ticket.
Cabin: The cabin number.
Embarked: The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data: Contains the raw Titanic dataset (train.csv and test.csv).
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and model building.
01_Data_Exploration.ipynb: Initial exploration of the dataset.
02_Feature_Engineering.ipynb: Feature engineering for model building.
03_Model_Training.ipynb: Building and training predictive models.
src: Python scripts with reusable functions.
data_preprocessing.py: Functions for cleaning and preprocessing data.
model_utils.py: Utility functions for building and evaluating models.
models: Saved model files.
